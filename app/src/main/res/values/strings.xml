    <!--O aplikaciji i kako koristiti-->
    <string name="howToUseApplication">How to use application</string>
    <string name="howToUseApplicationDescription">"Pill diary is a tool for persons that between all need to drink medicine for their diagnose. It helps you to manage your pill intake with correct name of the pill, date and time. It removes the need to memorize the time you took the pill if you took her at all and makes it easier to categorize it and search later.\nPanic calendar is a tool for persons that suffer from panic disorder or general panic attacks. Main problem with panic attacks and panic disorder in general is that we forget the symptoms and the feel we had when we experience the seizure but which is critical in fighting them when another attack comes. With panic calendar it is easy to give each attack strength, description and date and time it happened for further reference.\nFight club is a place where you can join many chat groups with people that have similar problems or create your own. There you can ask for advice, give advice to somebody else or connect with somebody on other platforms to more privately discuss your issues.  "</string>
    <string name="aboutApplicationLongText">This application is a project of a single person. Suffering for a few years from the problem that this application was made upon I tried to make something that would help people get with their diagnose easier or if they didn\'t have any not to fight their demons alone. It is estimated that every third person in the world suffers from some kind of anxiety and that is a huge number. Anxiety is a huge category that many smaller diagnoses fall into and that\'s why not every person can be subjected to the same treatment. Feeling most of this myself I know that sometimes conversation is the best cure and that\'s why I believe group chats are the strongest feature of this application. While that is sometimes enough sometimes you need additional help and several other in-app tools help to organize your daily struggle. Take note though that this isn\'t to be confused with real medical advice and is only here to help you fight or if you have tried everything else and you just want advice from other people.</string>
